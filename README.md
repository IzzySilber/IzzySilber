### Hi!


My name is Izzy, I'm a data analyst at Boston University School of Public Health within the Department of Global Health. 

At BUSPH, my current project is identifying a signature of biomarkers to classify viral, malarial, and bacterial diseases. In this project, I've used and evaluated three main machine learning/statistical methods.
